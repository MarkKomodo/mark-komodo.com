                <blockquote><i>‚ÄúKeno is a problematic guy who has issues with his own self esteem and self image, he steals photos and art and posts to desperately be something he isn't and to try to fit in to any community because he has been shut out of so many completely and utterly due to his own actions. He does not have any remorse for stealing photos and art, and despite getting multiple second chances from the community, continues to squander them by concontinuing to do the same things all the time. Every single time he has stolen my photos and been called out for it (Generally by me, when I hear about it) he is quick to delete them and leave the server or account he used then he sends me a message saying he's sorry and he'll never do it again, but I know from experience he'll do it again in a few months. Do not waste your time with him, or who he pretends to be for clout and attention that he, in all honesty, could get if he wasn't such a terrible person with no morals.‚Äù</i></blockquote>

                <blockquote><i>
                    ‚ÄúAround June or May of 2024 a member in my server invited Keno on his Typhlosion Nick account or what it was called. This member had a habit of inviting people without knoeing them so it is no surprise that they'd bring in someone like that sooner or later, I therefore cannot blame them. A mod of mine got their side of how they ran into Keno and screenshots are provided. Keno then was active on my server until The 3rd of December 2024, this is when we found out who he was. Until that point. He'd do the following things with me and my staff as well as a few active server members:
                    <li>Send blatantly stolen or otherwise fake irl photos, to try to get people to send him selfies...</li>
                    <li>Ask people if they thought him fat</li>
                    <li>Flirt around and call people pretty/cute, asking to hug them and so on.</li>
                    Good news first: He never got past doing this with anyone in my server, so we managed to get him out before he could do or try anything if he had any plans. But back to how he acted on our server... He began switching accounts without explanation (It was always just <b>"I lost it"</b> or <b>"I got hacked"</b>, no further elaborations). He also told lies to gain attention, claiming to suffer from severe obesity to the point of hospitilization. We in the staff got annoyed and suspicious with him, but like utter fools tried not to judge before we had anything concrete. However this December things came out: My admin, Nivlache compared the irl photos they received wit those from another servermember, Umbralenchy. The two realized that the images did not match up at all. This made my admin do some research on Keno's usernames, leading to the discovery of this google doc. I was not aware of this yet, but then one of the underage users on my server, Lime messaged me telling me that Keno had again "lost" an account and wanted to be reinvited. Since this was again without explanation I got suspicious, too and called a staff meeting, we chose to remove all of Keno's accounts before letting him back in, but then Niv showed me the google doc and... I pulled an all nighter ensuring that Keno had no more ways of contacting Lime and that everyone was warned of who he was. In rection to this discovery Mayfly (server nick: Yeetifly), an underage user who is on the staff also came out and revealed that Keno had messaged her in a flirty way, too. Upon hearing this, I resolved to gather and compile as much as possible of his time in our midst and submit it to the google doc in the hopes that it aids in preventing Keno from gaining a foothold elsewhere. The fact that Keno switched accounts a ton made it very difficult to procure screenshots, but the recountings of interactions with him all decribe the things I mentioned earlier:
                    <li>Flirting;</li>
                    <li>Asking about his weight;</li>
                    <li>Sharing stolen irl pics to manipulate others into sending selfies.</li>

                    Some occasions of him being flirty/trying to incinuate things with me:

                    My admin on how he came to look up who Keno was this week:

                    I requested Umbral's side as well as stuff from other users but those are the things I found going through my phone swiftly, Stuff like <b>"sleep on me"</b> and <b>"cuddle me"</b> he did say on my server to people, including the known minors...‚Äù
                    <figure>

                    </figure>
                    Another thing he kept dming people about:

                    </figure>
                    He also talked about how he would make a partner or pet fat... I should have screenshots of that somwhere, for now just know he also told me that and then went <b>"maybe I'll chonk you up"</b>. <br>
                    The person who invited Keno to my server being interrogated by a mod of mine on how he came to meet Keno:

                    </figure>
                    Other things I could dig up in the staff chat:

                    </figure>
                    The current overview of testimonies I received all match things seen in the screenshots provided above: Flirtatious stuff, lies about weight and irl pics, asking if people consider him fat... <br>
                    Poor Lime, he does not deserve to feel all this terror:

                    Mayfly, the other underage user's reaction to finding out who Keno was... I asked her to see if she can get screencaps or at least remember more but- This alone is scary already:

                        ‚ÄúUm I just remembered that a few months back when he was Fruitbasked he DMed me and I don‚Äôt remember what he talked about- but I think he was flirting with me 0-o. I guess he hasked me about his weight too‚Ä¶ I had said that I‚Äôd never seen him irl so I couldn‚Äôt say for sure, but that his weight isn‚Äôt super important.. then se haid he wanted to work out bc he hated his body, and I said if he wanted to then he should. Um lemme think what else. He sent me pictures of himself (probably for pity ^eyeroll^) and I said that I didn‚Äôt think he was far, he looked fine, he asked for pictures of me (lol NOPE [no pictures for him]), and then he started the flirting‚Ä¶ said that I was pretty; I‚Äôm not sure what else. this was months ago.‚Äù

                    <blockquote><i>‚ÄúKeno is truthfully someone who keeps no promises after not even a day most likely, I dont interact with him anymore because my drama with him has long past, but when it did happen I seriously dont know what goes through his head when the simplest and easiest thing to do with stealing, is to not steal‚Äî I was truly devastated when I found out he was stealing my art/ character who was a minor for their own pleasure, it really sickened me, and even if he knew it was a minor he kept doing it! Not until it got even more serious- but atp its basically too late because he made a name for himself in that area of crime too- when all he could have done was just delete everything about that character that he claimed to be his. Even when he did credit me for the artwork, he should know better that I do not want him to be interacting with my characters ever again after such a foul incident.. I talked with him throughly about his mistakes and he kept going on and on about being sorry but he always says it with empty pockets, nothing to show for it! Its just rinse and repeat except his hands are still dirty and keep getting dirtier.. I do hope that one day when he says he‚Äôll stop, he‚Äôll actually stop.‚Äù</i></blockquote>
                <h4><u><b><i>Anonymous 'British' User</i></b> Testimonial</u>:</h4>
                    <blockquote><i>‚ÄúKeno is a vile and disgusting person. For a long time he was under the radar of the server he was in, we all saw him as a adorable and cuddly guy, who was always talking positively and fun to talk to. Then things got strange. He would Dm people about his weight, asking for validation that it was okay to be his size. He would eventually send pictures of his morbidly obese body, eventually I would discover some of these pictures are stolen. He would causally ask minors in dms about his weight, it eventually became clear to me that he was not asking for validation of his weight but sexual gratification. He was fixated on talking about his belly to a strange level, it was clearly visible it was some kind of fetish to him. He is a disgusting person. <br>
                        This man needs to be locked up, getting sexual gratification from minors commenting on his weight is disgusting, then finding out he is proud to be a zoophile and necrophile. This man deserves justice and to be put in jail. This man is a threat to minors, animals and the bodies of those who have passed along.‚Äù</i>
